# Google-Docs-Clone
The Google Docs frontend interface provides a user-friendly environment for creating, editing, and collaborating on documents online.

Menu Bar: At the top of the page, you'll find a menu bar with options like File, Edit, View, Insert, Format, Table, Tools, and Help. These menus contain various commands and settings for managing your document.

Toolbar: Below the menu bar, there is a toolbar that includes buttons for commonly used actions such as formatting text, aligning paragraphs, inserting images, creating links, and more. The toolbar allows you to quickly access frequently used functions.

Document Area: The majority of the screen is dedicated to the document area. This is where you create and edit your document. The document area provides a blank canvas to type, format text, insert images, tables, and other elements.

Sidebar: On the right side of the screen, there is a sidebar that offers additional functionality. The sidebar may include features like document outline, research tools, add-ons, and document settings. The specific options available in the sidebar may vary depending on your document's settings and any add-ons you have installed.
